StressSense AI is a full-stack MERN-based web application integrated with an AI-powered 
predictive model that analyzes user responses to assess their stress levels. The system 
leverages Machine Learning, Flask microservices, Docker, and MongoDB to deliver real-time 
predictions through a modern and responsive user interface.

The frontend is developed using React.js, providing a clean, interactive, and 
mobile-responsive user experience. Users fill out a form with various behavioral and 
lifestyle parameters, which are then sent securely to the backend for prediction. The 
frontend also supports features like dark mode, form validation, and animated modal results 
to enhance usability.

On the backend, Express.js and Node.js handle API requests, route management, and 
communication between the React frontend and the AI microservice. The AI model, built with 
Python (Flask), uses logistic regression and a standard scaler to process user inputs and 
predict the stress level (e.g., low, medium, or high). This microservice is containerized 
and runs independently for scalability and modularity.

Data storage is managed using MongoDB, which keeps user logs, prediction records, and 
feedback securely. The entire system is orchestrated using Docker Compose, ensuring seamless 
deployment of all services — frontend, backend, ML service, and database — as isolated yet 
interconnected containers.

Additionally, the project is integrated with Git & GitHub for version control and hosted 
locally via Docker, with compatibility for deployment on Azure Cloud.
