A ticket booking system was developed using Node.js and Express.js to manage concurrent 
seat reservations. Seats are stored in-memory with states as available, locked, or booked. 
A seat locking mechanism was implemented where a lock is held for one minute and requires 
a unique lockId to confirm booking. Automatic expiry of locks ensures seats are released 
if not confirmed in time. API endpoints were created to view seats, lock, confirm, and 
unlock them with proper success and error messages. A test script was also written to simulate 
multiple clients trying to lock the same seat simultaneously, demonstrating safe handling of 
concurrency.
