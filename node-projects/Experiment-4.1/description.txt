A CLI Employee Management System was developed using Node.js and the readline module. 
The application provides an interactive menu that allows users to add new employees, list 
all employees, remove employees by their ID, or exit the program. An in-memory array is 
used to store employee details such as name and ID, ensuring data is managed directly 
during the session. Input validations were included to prevent empty entries and duplicate 
IDs. The menu is designed to reappear after every operation, giving users a continuous 
interactive experience. Finally, the program exits cleanly with a goodbye message when the 
quit option is selected.
