A REST API was created using Express.js to manage a small collection of playing cards. 
The data is stored in an in-memory array, with each card having an id, suit, and value. 
Endpoints were implemented to list all cards, fetch a card by its ID, add a new card, and 
delete a card by its ID. Each operation returns proper JSON responses along with suitable 
status codes. A root route was also added to confirm the server is running. The API follows 
RESTful principles and runs locally on port 3000.
