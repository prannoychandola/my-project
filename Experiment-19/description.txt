This workflow is responsible for building and deploying the project. 
It includes steps for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, 
building the project, and pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub. 
The configuration uses Node.js as the runtime and ensures all build tasks 
are executed in sequence whenever the workflow is triggered manually or 
through code updates. The build process completes successfully, as indicated 
by all executed steps such as setting up the job, checking out the repository, 
configuring Node.js, installing dependencies, building the Docker image, 
authenticating with Docker Hub, and pushing the image to the repository. 
This confirms that the CI/CD pipeline is functioning correctly and the Docker 
image is built and deployed without errors.
