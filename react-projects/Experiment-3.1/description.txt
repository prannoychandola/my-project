The task is to create a reusable React component named ProductCard that takes props for product name, 
price, and stock status, and displays them clearly in a styled layout. By passing different values as props, 
the same component can dynamically render multiple product variations without changing the component code, 
demonstrating the flexibility and reusability of props in React.
