This project implements a basic drawing tool using the HTML5 <canvas> element
The JavaScript code attaches event listeners (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) to track mouse input and render lines dynamically
The 2D context API (getContext('2d')) is used with defined properties such as lineWidth, lineCap, and strokeStyle for smooth strokes
A state flag manages active drawing, while previous cursor coordinates are updated to create continuous lines
The CSS centers the canvas on the page, applies spacing, and adds borders to both the container and drawing area
